# Not_Like_You
Hello this is a extended version from Skip Wilson tutorial available on youtube. I fixed some of the minor bugs with quick fixes and I reorganized the files to better manipulate and add extensibiity for the files. I added a random counter to make the enemies appear at randomly with a min of 5 enemies and a max of 10. I also made them appear randomly on the Y axis instead of hardcoding and added a enemy that moves in a line. Was planning to implement other features in future updates, but this is project is currently in hiatus for the moment being. 
I doubt anyone will read this but I just wanna document this in case to comment more.
